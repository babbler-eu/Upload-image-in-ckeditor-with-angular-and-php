# Upload Image In Ckeditor With Angular And Php

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.7.

## First Step
Run `npm install ./ckeditor`
Run `npm install`

## Second Step 
you need to create a directory inside your localhost named "/server", and you need to copy the upload.php file. Inside the "/server" directory you have to create another one called "/image", all this and just to make my example work, clearly you can call them whatever you want.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.# Upload-image-in-ckeditor-with-angular-and-php
